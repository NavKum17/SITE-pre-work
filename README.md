## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[None]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[No significant challenge, it took some time for me to think about how to implement the guess function, but using the solution code I got
through this easily. Overall the pre-work was interesting and I enjoyed working on it and learning new things.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I am now thinking about how it works to make this webpage public: how to make it so that people can find this game through google and other web browsers.
Additionally I am thinking about what it would take to be able to have thousands of people around the world on this webpage on the same time, that is I want
to learn the details behind hosting this webpage on a server and what is required to do it successfully. Furthermore, I am curious about other software I have
heard about like Node, AngularJS, and Bootstrap, what is thier role in web development and how do they work.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[All the additional features are interesting, I would have liked to implement all of them, but if I only had a few more hours I think I would try to implement additional features 3,4 and 5 first (random secret, 3 strikes and adding images) 
Additionally I would have liked to add some sort of round tracker, that displays what round you are on and how many rounds left to win. Then I would have tried to implement a input that determines what the end round is. 
I think the code I have from the instructions is pretty well organised and readable so I dont think I would spend much time on refactoring.]
